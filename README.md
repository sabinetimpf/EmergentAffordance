# Modelling Affordances as Emergent Phenomena

Affordances are an important basis for many human-environment interactions such as navigation or geo-design. In this short paper prepared for the **[GISCience Conference 2023](https://giscience2023.github.io/)** we present an approach to modelling affordances based on treating affordances as emergent phenomena in an agent-based simulation. We use the notion of an affordance schema to represent the setting in which the emergence of an affordance is made possible. We use a case study to show that (unexpected) affordances emerge during the course of the simulation. While the general approach is promising and may be used for other emergent phenomena such as landmarks, we also acknowledge and discuss the problems incurred during the modelling process. The paper closes with a reflection and some ideas for future work.


This repository contains the code and data we are working on to model affordances and affordances schemata.

## How to use this repository

The model we work on is called aff_ParkScenario. It is represented in the form of an xml file and the file name contains a version number. In addition, some pictures are used to better visualize the individual objects within the model. Those may be found in the zip-folder named pictures.

In order to run the model you will need a working version of the software called **[SeSAm](https://multiagentsimulation.com/)**, which is a fully visual platform for developing and simulation agent-based models. We also use some extensions to SeSAm, which may be found in the folder extensions.
